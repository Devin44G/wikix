# Wikix - Built with Laravel

### An outline/idea manager for writers

### Project Info:
- STATUS: Under development
- PRIORITY: Mid-High [passion project]

### Product Overview:
If you're familiar with the tool **WikidPad**, you have a general idea of what I'm building here. **WikidPad** is an incredibly robust tool for organization of ideas, plans, etc. However, the learning curve is *steep*.

The goal with **Wikix** is to have a similarly (though not quite) robust tool with a far lesser learning curve (through utilization of a simpler GUI), so user can start using it immediately. Furthermore, though anyone will be free to use it, **Wikix** will be geared solely toward the needs of writers, allowing for:
- [x] Creation of Projects
- [x] Creation of Story Docs (outlines) and Definition Doc (a sort of glossary for the people, places, and words in one's story)
- [x] The ability to link "definitions" in a Story Doc to its corresponding Definition Doc, for easy cross-referencing.

As a writer of epic fantasy, this has always been a tool I've wanted to have. As a developer, I finally decided to build it for myself (and others who'd like to use it). Follow its progress right here!
